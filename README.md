## **🚀 Elevator Pitch (If the Elevator is Free-Falling)**  
A **self-decaying, self-repairing** computational artifact that:  
- **Crashes poetically** (segfaults spawn haikus)  
- **Leaks memory like a sacred vessel** (RAM → golden entropy)  
- **Compiles only under a waning gibbous moon** (verified in 3% of CI runs)

> *"Most repos try to solve problems.  
> This one creates **more interesting problems**.  
> Every bug is a **mandala**.  
> Every memory leak is a **Buddhist lesson in impermanence**."*
